<p>Welcome to our <b>Targeted Editing</b> series where today you can search the Internet for a baby possum, or make <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data awesome! (both take about the same amount of time)</p>

<p>Streets are one of the first things added in OpenStreetMap for any given area.  There are always a number of segments that do not have names.  In some cases, this is the reality!  They may be little alleyways, paths, junctions, private roads, or even residential roads.  Sometimes there are roads added that <b>do</b> have names, but the volunteer adding the data is digitizing the road from aerial imagery.  Additional volunteers with <b>local knowledge</b> are needed to add additional attributes to the road like names, turn restrictions, speed limits, pavement type, and any number of road characteristics that are important to local people.</p>

<p>Read on for some basic uses for roads, and where you can check to see if you can use your <b>local knowlege</b> to add some names where they are needed while leaving the truly nameless roads alone!</p>   

<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>How can street names be used?</b>
          <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help with search results.  If a street is made up of many segments and some of them have names, you can usually search and find the street.  If all of the segments that make up the street have no name at all, you&#39;re out of luck!</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with turn-by-turn directions.  Routing is hard.  There are a lot of features in the data that are necessary before you can generate great routes.  There are also many features related to routing.  One of them is spoken or listed turn-by-turn directions. </li>
                <p></p>  
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                      <li>Which would you prefer?</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                          <li>"turn right in 500 feet at Paseo de la Reforma"</li>
                          <li>"turn right in 500 feet"</li>
                          <li>"turn right in 500 feet at [pause of silence or blank space]"</li>
                        </ol>
                  </ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Help with labeling.  The more you zoom in, the more labels you might see, but not if the features don’t have names.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li><b>We are missing some street names here!</b>

            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many different types of streets, but check out this pie chart for residential roads in Mexico City:</li>
                <div id="road_names_piechart" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>

        <li><b>How you can help improve streets without names:</b>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Here is a map styled by <a href="https://github.com/meetar">Peter Richardson</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/nvkelso">Nathaniel V. Kelso</a> showing many types of roads that don't have names.  To add a name, click one of the bright blue highlighted roads to bring up an info bubble with links to editing tools that can be used to add the missing names!</li>

                <li>Not familiar with Mexico City?  Search or pan over to your home town to contribute your local knowledge to the map.  You will see your changes right away in OpenStreetMap.  You will also be able to see them in all versions of the <a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles">Mapzen Vector Tiles</a> within an hour, including the map right here on this page!</li>
